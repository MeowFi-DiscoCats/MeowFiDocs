As we continue to expand the DiscoCats ecosystem, we've strategically chosen Berachain as a foundational platform for our offerings. Berachain's innovative Proof of Liquidity (PoL) consensus mechanism aligns seamlessly with our mission to deliver multi-layered yield experiences, particularly through products like NFT Time-Lock Vaults, Liquid Launch, Bribe Wars, and PreSale Vaults.

## **Proof of Liquidity: Empowering Yield**

Berachain's PoL mechanism incentivizes validators to direct Bera Governance Token (BGT) emissions towards liquidity gauges established by various protocols. This creates a competitive environment where protocols offer "bribes" to validators to channel BGT emissions to specific liquidity pools. These gauges then distribute BGT rewards to users based on their share of deposited liquidity, fostering a balanced ecosystem that encourages both liquidity provision and validator participation.

For DiscoCats, this structure enables an additional layer of yield through active engagement in Berachain's liquidity pools. Protocols offering bribes to validators create indirect incentives, allowing DiscoCats to benefit not just once but through repeated cycles of validator rewards and protocol-driven bribes. This dual-layer incentive system enhances earnings for our holders.

## **Why Bears for the Cats?**

1. **PoL Rewards**: Berachain's consensus model ensures that projects contributing to chain liquidity are rewarded, aligning perfectly with DiscoCats' objective to earn additional yield by actively participating in the chain's liquidity infrastructure.

2. **Bribe Mechanisms**: Protocols strategically bid for liquidity through bribes, ensuring that DiscoCats holders benefit from continuous, competitive incentives.

3. **Community and Ecosystem Integration**: Building on Berachain allows us to tap into an ecosystem rich in established DeFi products, streamlining development and enabling seamless integration of liquidity solutions.

## **The Role of RFB (Request for Broposal)**

Berachain's RFB program distributes initial BERA token supply to protocols that contribute to the ecosystem, with 70% mandated for ecosystem rewards. This presents opportunities for projects like DiscoCats to access early-stage BERA incentives, which can be utilized to amplify yield through validator bribes. Validators, attracted by the prospect of acquiring BERA with deep liquidity and ecosystem value, are likely to engage with gauges that align with these incentives.

## **Conclusion**

Berachain's PoL model aligns with DiscoCats' goal of providing multi-layered yields. By participating in the PoL and leveraging the RFB program, DiscoCats positions itself as a yield-optimized NFT project that not only earns from traditional sources but also capitalizes on Berachain's unique ecosystem to enhance value for holders.
