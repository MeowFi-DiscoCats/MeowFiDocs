As we expand the Cats ecosystem, we’ve chosen Monad as a key deployment hub for our products. While also building on Berachain, Monad offers unique advantages that align perfectly with our vision for NFT Time Lock Vaults, Bribe Wars, Liquid Launch, and PreSale Vaults—each designed to provide multi-layered yield with maximum flexibility.

## Performance & Scalability

Monad's parallel execution model significantly improves transaction throughput and reduces gas fees compared to traditional chains. This means our users can experience faster transactions, minimal congestion, and a seamless experience—even under high network demand unlike Solana or Ethereum. Given that some of our products involve high-frequency transactions (like Bribe Wars), Monad’s architecture ensures smooth execution without bottlenecks.

Additionally, Monad’s scalability helps us reach more users and projects looking to create vaults. Our vaults would get heavily loaded upon launch, and this is where Monad truly shines. With its 10,000 TPS capacity, gas fees remain virtually zero, allowing us to even sponsor transaction costs for our users without hesitation.

## Vision and Compatibility

Monad is fully EVM-compatible, making it easy for us to deploy our smart contracts without significant modifications. Additionally, our smart contracts and frontend code wouldn't need to be audited again, which ensures security and gives users confidence.

While we are deploying across multiple chains, Monad is where we see long-term potential to scale and refine our offerings. Its emphasis on high-speed execution, low fees, and robust ecosystem makes it an ideal environment for us to experiment, optimize, and bring our products to market.

## Final Thoughts

Monad is built for speed, efficiency, and scalability—qualities that are crucial to attract and retain users for our offerings. By making Monad one of our hubs, we ensure that our products have the strongest possible foundation, offering users the best experience while staying ahead of the competition.

We’re launching very soon—stay tuned!
