## Bribe Wars by DiscoCats

Bribe Wars introduces a revolutionary governance model for our Multi-Layer Yield Bearing NFTs where projects and even users can incentivize votes to direct liquidity into their preferred pools. This dynamic system ensures that liquidity flows to the most promising projects through a competitive and rewarding process.

## How It Works

1. **Project Selection:** Three projects are presented for MeowFi NFT holders to vote on.
2. **Incentive Period:** Before voting begins, an open incentive period allows anyone—users or projects—to add bribes. These bribes can come in various forms, such as tokens, NFTs, whitelist spots, or even airdrops, making the competition engaging and rewarding.
3. **Voting Phase:** NFT holders cast their votes, controlling the order flow of liquidity.
4. **Fund Distribution:** The winning project receives the allocated liquidity, while contributors to the two unselected projects can reclaim their funds. This ensures a fair system where no one loses out, but the battle for votes remains intense.

## Why Participate?

### For Users

- **Earn rewards** in tokens, NFTs, or other incentives just by voting.
- **Shape liquidity allocation** and support the projects you believe in.
- **Secure governance power** while maintaining flexibility—your NFT-backed investment remains redeemable.

### For Projects

- **Attract liquidity** through direct engagement with NFT holders.
- **Leverage strategic bribes** to outcompete other projects.
- **Gain valuable market insights** by seeing where users direct their votes.

## The Future of Bribe Wars

In the future, Bribe Wars will expand beyond Meow Finance, allowing other projects to use our governance model and in-house bribe mechanism to control their own treasury and liquidity allocation. This will create an ecosystem where multiple projects can compete for governance power, driving greater engagement and innovation in open and decentralized manner.

Bribe Wars isn’t just about liquidity—it’s about empowering communities, rewarding participation, and setting a new standard for governance in the space.
