## How It Works

### Step 1: Participate in the Sale

- Users contribute funds to a fixed-price sale in exchange for an NFT-backed allocation.
- The funds are locked within the vault until TGE.

### Step 2: Trade Your Allocation (Optional)

- Users can list their allocation NFT on marketplaces and sell it to others who want exposure.
- The allocation price may increase if demand rises before TGE, allowing traders to profit from pre-market hype.

### Step 3: Exit Anytime (With Penalty)

- Users can withdraw their funds before TGE by paying a penalty.
- The penalty fees are used to buy back project tokens, benefiting those who remain in the sale.

### Step 4: Claim Tokens at TGE

- Once the project’s TGE occurs, users redeem their allocation NFT for the corresponding tokens.
- The allocation NFT is burned upon claiming.
