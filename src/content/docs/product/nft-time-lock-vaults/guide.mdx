## How It Works

1. **Deposit into the Vault:**
   - Users can deposit funds or NFTs into either Fixed or Flexible Lock-Up Vaults.
   - For Fixed Lock-Up Vaults, users must also lock a Partner NFT along with their funds for a predetermined period.
   - For Flexible Lock-Up Vaults, users can lock their assets with more flexibility and may choose to withdraw earlier, with conditions.

2. **Earn Yield:**
   - While in the vault, users earn yield from:
     - Additional bribes from partnered protocols
     - Lending/LP yield generated by the assets
     - Emissions from the vaultâ€™s growth
     - Fees generated within the vault ecosystem

3. **Trade Vault Positions:**
   - **Flexible Vaults:** Users can trade their vault positions on marketplaces, offering liquidity and flexibility even during the lock-up period.
   - **Fixed Vaults:** Positions are not tradable until the lock-up period ends, ensuring the stability and structure of the vault.

4. **Withdraw or Exit:**
   - Users can withdraw their funds or NFTs at the end of the lock-up period for Fixed Vaults, or earlier for Flexible Vaults with the associated conditions.

## Benefits of NFT Time Lock Vaults

### For Partners:

- **Locked Liquidity with Low User Acquisition Cost:** Projects can secure long-term liquidity without needing expensive marketing campaigns or high incentives to attract users.
- **Additional Utility for NFTs:** By integrating their NFTs into the vault system, projects can offer holders new use cases beyond collectibles, increasing demand and engagement.
- **Reduces Sell Pressure on NFTs:** Locking NFTs in vaults prevents immediate resale, helping stabilize floor prices and reducing market volatility.
- **Revenue Share from Vault Fees:** Partner projects earn a portion of the vault fees, creating an additional revenue stream beyond their primary ecosystem. This incentivizes long-term collaboration and sustainability.

### For Users:

- **Earn Without Strict Locking:** Flexible vaults allow users to benefit from locked assets while keeping their positions tradable. This means users can still access liquidity if needed while earning rewards.
- **Multiple Yield Streams & Bribes (Multi-Layer Yield):** Users earn from various sources, including partner bribes, lending/LP rewards, emissions, and vault-generated fees. These combined earnings not only boost returns but also increase the backing ratio of their NFT over time.
- **Exclusive Airdrops & Additional Rewards:** Vault participants gain access to special incentives, such as exclusive airdrops and perks from partnered projects, creating an extra earning layer beyond standard staking.
