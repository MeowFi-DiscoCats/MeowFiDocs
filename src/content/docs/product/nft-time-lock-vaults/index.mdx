<Aside title="TL;DR:" type="note">
    NFT Time-Lock Vaults offer multi-layered yield through emissions, bribes, and incentives. Users lock funds in NFT-backed vaults to earn rewards while maintaining tradable liquidity.

- **Fixed Lock-Up Vaults:** Higher yields, but funds & NFTs are locked for a set period. Not tradable.
- **Flexible Lock-Up Vaults:** Tradable positions with yield from bribes, lending, emissions, and fees.

</Aside>

NFT Time-Lock Vaults are designed to provide a multi-layer yield to holders by leveraging emissions, bribes, and other incentives. When users purchase an NFT from a vault, their funds are locked for a specified period, during which they earn enhanced yield. These vaults are NFT-backed, ensuring that liquidity is secured and tradable.
