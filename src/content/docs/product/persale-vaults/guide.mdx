### How It Works

1. For Eco PreSale Vaults: Lock Partner NFTs + Funds  
   - Users must lock their Partner NFTs and funds (in stablecoins or project-specific tokens) into the PreSales Vault for a predetermined period.  
   - This creates a commitment-based entry system, ensuring only serious participants gain access while minimizing bot interference.

2. Oversubscription Handling  
   - If demand exceeds supply, projects can choose from multiple options to distribute presale spots fairly:
     - Lottery: Random selection of eligible participants.
     - Gamified Access: Users complete on-chain or social tasks to qualify.
     - Social Verification: Proof-of-identity or community-based access requirements.
     - Lock-In Periods: Priority given to users who lock their funds/NFTs for longer durations.
     - Tiered Access: Projects can set different allocation tiers based on contribution levels.

3. Get Access to the Presale  
   - Once the lock period ends, eligible participants receive presale NFTs airdropped directly to their wallets at launch.  
   - Locked Partner NFTs and funds act as a ticket to the presale, ensuring only engaged users participate.

## Example Use Case

A project wants to prevent bots and create a fair presale. They launch a PreSales Vault where users must lock a Partner NFT + 1,000 USDC for 2 weeks. In return, they receive:
- 10% discount on the NFT launch price.
- NFT airdropped on the launch day.
- Exclusive access or benefits for future project events or NFTs.

If oversubscribed, the project chooses a lottery system to fairly distribute allocations.

The PreSales Vault system not only secures a fair and transparent presale but also enhances community involvement, making every launch a high-energy event.
