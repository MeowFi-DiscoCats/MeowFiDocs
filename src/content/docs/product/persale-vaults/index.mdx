PreSale Vaults: Fair, Secure, and Hype-Driven Fundraising

PreSale Vaults provide a secure and structured way for NFT projects to conduct their presale or ecosystem sale, eliminating common issues like botting, unfair FCFS (First Come, First Serve) mechanics, and artificial sellouts. With multiple options for oversubscription handling—such as lotteries, gamified selection, social verification, or lock-in mechanisms—projects gain flexibility while ensuring fairness.

## Security & Fairness

**Anti-Bot Mechanism:** Locking NFTs and funds significantly reduces bot activity, ensuring only verified users participate.

**Transparent & Fair:** Eliminates chaotic FCFS mints by making participation commitment-based. Oversubscription Handling: Projects can choose from multiple options if demand exceeds supply:

- **Lottery:** Random selection of eligible participants.
- **Gamified Access:** Users complete tasks to qualify.
- **Social Verification:** Proof-of-identity checks or community-based access.
- **Lock-In Periods:** Priority given to users who lock funds for longer durations.

## User Benefits

 **Discounted Price:** Early participants get NFTs at a discounted price, incentivizing commitment.<br/> 
 **Exclusive Perks:** Gain additional benefits from partnered protocols, such as airdrops, whitelist spots, or access to rare content.<br/>
 **Increased Visibility:** Public vault metrics (total participants, funds locked) help build pre-launch hype.<br/>
 **Flexibility:** Users can unlock their funds before the presale ends (with a penalty), giving them optionality while prioritizing committed buyers.<br/>

## Project Benefits

**Organized & Bot-Free Presale:** Ensures a committed community and prevents unfair distribution.<br/> 
**Hype & Engagement:** Vault stats create a real-time "hype meter" for the launch.<br/> 
**Stronger Community Ties:** Offering exclusive perks for vault participants builds long-term engagement and projects can use the insights.
