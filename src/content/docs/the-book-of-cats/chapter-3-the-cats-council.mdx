Governance is crafted to put power directly in the hands of NFT holders. The Cat’s Council embodies this principle, allowing holders to play a pivotal role in shaping the project's direction.

## Treasury Control and Protocol Interactions

At the core of Meow Finance governance is treasury control by the holders. They hold the keys to the funds, allowing them to decide how resources are allocated across the ecosystem. This isn’t just about managing assets; it creates a unique environment where protocols compete to earn their trust and investment.

**This is where the Bribe Wars come into play.** Protocols that wish to engage with MeowFi must participate in the Bribe Wars, offering bribes to secure liquidity allocation from the treasury. This mechanism ensures that only the most promising protocols get a slice of the pie, while incentivizing holders with additional rewards and boosting liquidity within the ecosystem.

## Council Meetings

Regular council meetings will be held where holders discuss and decide on key issues, such as fund allocations and strategic directions. These meetings are open to all NFT holders, promoting transparency and collaborative decision-making. Through these discussions, stakers collectively guide the project’s evolution and ensure that it reflects the community’s goals.

## Future Horizons

Looking ahead, MeowFi envisions cross-chain expansions and building NFT vaults, which could further enhance yield opportunities for holders.
